# ü¶¥ Bone Fracture Detection ‚Äì Project Plan

This document describes the adapted roadmap for the bone fracture detection module, aligning with the existing codebase (transfer learning + dataset balancing + training pipeline). Contributors can follow the phases and tasks below to gradually expand functionality.

---

## üìã Objectives

- Use transfer learning (VGG16) as the core backbone for fracture detection  
- Balance classes and create robust dataset splits (train / val / test)  
- Fine-tune, unfreeze layers, and improve performance  
- Add downstream components: inference, explainability, deployment, documentation  
- Ensure reproducibility and modularity so contributors can extend or swap modules easily

## üéØ Project Overview

This project implements a deep learning method for detecting bone fractures in X-ray images using transfer learning. The current implementation (baseline) reports **‚âà96.05 % accuracy** with VGG16 and balanced datasets. We aim to open this up for Hacktoberfest contributors to add enhancements, better documentation, and new features.

## üîç Existing Baseline Architecture Summary

1. Dataset is balanced by copying + downsampling the majority class  
2. Split proportions: train 70 %, val 15 %, test 15 %  
3. Training uses `ImageDataGenerator` with augmentation (rotations, shifts, flips, zoom)  
4. Base model: **VGG16 (pretrained)** with top layers removed; added Flatten ‚Üí Dense(512) ‚Üí Dropout ‚Üí Dense(1, sigmoid)  
5. Loss: binary_crossentropy; optimizer: Adam  
6. Callbacks: EarlyStopping, ModelCheckpoint (save best model)  
7. Fine-tuning: unfreeze some VGG16 layers and retrain at a lower learning rate  
8. Evaluation: compute metrics, confusion matrix, classification report on test set  

We will build on this by modularizing and expanding.

## üõ† Phases & Tasks

| Phase | Tasks / Deliverables |
|---|---|
| **Phase 1: Setup & Documentation** | - Organize folder structure: `data/`, `models/`, `inference/`, `utils/`  <br> - Add `README.md` describing how baseline works  <br> - Create `requirements.txt` listing dependencies  <br> - Document how to run training code (with CLI arguments) |
| **Phase 2: Dataset Preprocessing Module** | - Create `prepare_dataset.py` for balancing + splitting, with configurable paths <br> - Replace hardcoded paths with parameters or config <br> - Add logging of class counts, split sizes |
| **Phase 3: Training Module** | - Move training code into `train.py` accepting arguments (epochs, batch size, learning rate, etc.) <br> - Save best model & optionally intermediate checkpoints <br> - Log training history and save plots (loss, accuracy curves) |
| **Phase 4: Inference & Evaluation Module** | - Add `inference/predict.py` to load model and predict on an image or directory <br> - Add `inference/evaluate.py` to compute metrics against a test set <br> - Standardize input/output interfaces (image path ‚Üí prediction) |
| **Phase 5: Explainability & Visualization** | - Integrate Grad-CAM or similar technique for heatmap overlays <br> - Add utility to overlay heatmap on original image <br> - Provide example visualizations in repository |
| **Phase 6: Demo / UI** | - Build a minimal web app (Streamlit / Gradio / Flask) to upload X-ray and show prediction + visualization <br> - Wrap inference module into the app <br> - Optionally containerize (Docker) for easier deployment |
| **Phase 7: Evaluation & Benchmarking** | - Use cross-validation / k-fold splits for robustness <br> - Compare variants: dropout, learning rates, unfreezing strategies <br> - Plot ROC curves, confusion matrices, loss/accuracy trends <br> - Write a summary notebook or report |
| **Phase 8: Extensibility & Community Engagement** | - Refactor so users can swap backbone models (not just VGG16) <br> - Add tests / sanity checks (e.g. validate image shapes) <br> - Document how to contribute (architecture addition, module updates) <br> - Suggest issue ideas: bounding box localization, multi-class fractures, model pruning |

## üß≠ Getting Started Instructions for Contributors

1. Fork and clone the repository  
2. Create a branch like `feature/plan-update` or `feature/inference-module`  
3. Begin with **Phase 1**: setup folder structure, README, requirements  
4. Proceed to Phase 2: build preprocessing module (`prepare_dataset.py`)  
5. Commit & push your branch, open a PR  
6. Work in small incremental steps ‚Äî inference, explainability, etc.  
7. Continuously test locally on a subset of data to ensure the code runs

## ‚ö† Notes & Considerations

- Change absolute dataset paths (like `/kaggle/input/...`) to relative or configurable parameters  
- Model weights can be large; store only final / best weights or reference external download links  
- When augmenting data, ensure transformations remain plausible for medical images  
- Ensure heatmaps align correctly with original image scales  
- Keep in mind class imbalance ‚Äî consider weighted loss functions or oversampling if needed  
- Add disclaimers: the tool is research / demo only; it is **not** a substitute for professional diagnosis
